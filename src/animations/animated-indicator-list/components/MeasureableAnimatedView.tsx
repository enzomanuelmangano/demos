// Basically the same as Animated.View, but with a reanimatedMeasure function
// that returns the measured dimensions of the view.
// The point is that we want an array of refs to get the layout of the headers
// but we can't define an array of Refs by using the useAnimatedRef hook.
// In the Main file, we use a useMemo hook to create an array of refs.

// --- Code (useHeaderLayout.ts) ---
// const headersLayoutXRefs = useConst(() =>
//   headers.map(() => React.createRef<MeasureableAnimatedViewRef>()),
// );
// --- End of code from (useHeaderLayout.ts) ---

// If it was possible to define an array of refs with useAnimatedRef, we could
// use the useAnimatedRef hook instead of the React.createRef<MeasureableAnimatedViewRef>() function.
// Basically something like that:
// const headersLayoutXRefs = useConst(() =>
//   headers.map(() => useAnimatedRef<Animated.View>())
// );
// Unfortunately, it's not possible to map through the useAnimatedRef hook.

// So the trick is that we create an array of refs with the React.createRef<MeasureableAnimatedViewRef>() function
// and then we use the useAnimatedRef hook to get the ref of the Animated.View.
// We pass the ref of the Animated.View to the MeasureableAnimatedView component.

// The MeasureableAnimatedView component has a reanimatedMeasure function that returns the measured dimensions of the view.
// We use the reanimatedMeasure function to get the layout of the headers.

// I know that's super abstract as an explanation, but I hope it helps.
// Simply keep in mind that the MeasureableAnimatedView component is just a wrapper around Animated.View.
// That can be useful if you want to get the layout of a view by using a React Ref instead of a Reanimated Ref.
