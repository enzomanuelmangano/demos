# Instagram Shared Transition

## Current Status: Under Maintenance

This animation is currently **broken** while transitioning to the New Architecture.

### Why is it broken?

Shared Transitions are not yet fully supported in React Native's New Architecture. This animation relies heavily on shared element transitions to create the Instagram-like navigation experience between screens.

A fix is coming soon!
