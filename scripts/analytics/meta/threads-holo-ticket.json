  "description": "An interactive 3D flippable ticket component featuring a dynamic holographic effect created with Skia. The ticket can be rotated via pan and tap gestures, revealing a QR code on the back side. The holographic effect uses a sophisticated masking system with moving gradients that respond to rotation, creating an iridescent gold-and-blue shimmer effect reminiscent of holographic security features on physical tickets.",
