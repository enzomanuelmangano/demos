## Roadmap

This project is a work in progress (almost by definition). Here are the current priorities:

- [x] Remove deprecated APIs: runOnJS and runOnUI should now be imported from react-native-worklets
- [ ] Fix navigation setup: the project started with React Navigation, but we’re migrating to Expo Router. The repo currently feels like a mix of both.
- [ ] Drawer Navigation: currently the navigation is quite unintuitive and needs to be improved.
- [ ] Ensure consistent haptics support (use [pressto](https://github.com/enzomanuelmangano/pressto) whenever possible)
- [ ] Optimize performance in Shaders demos
- [ ] Feedback screen on Shake Detection
- [ ] TestFlight Release
- [ ] Android Release (starting with App Tester / Firebase Distribution)

## Quick Start

# List all available animations
npx demos-cli list

# Install globally
npm install -g demos-cli
demos get airbnb-slider
```

### Running the Demo App

This is an Expo Go project. To get started:

```bash
bun install
bun ios     # for iOS
# or
